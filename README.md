# My Python Journey 🐍

<p> Hey there!  
This repo is where I’m learning and practicing Python. I’ve added small programs,<br>
concept demos, and some mini-projects as I go. It’s basically my coding notebook! </p>

## What you'll find here:
- Basics of Python (like loops, functions, etc.)
- Practice programs
- Some beginner-friendly projects
- Random ideas I tried while learning

## Why I made this:
I wanted a space to keep track of what I’m learning and improve by practicing regularly.  
Also, it’s fun to look back and see how far I’ve come :)

## Tools I’m using:
- Python 3
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook (depends on my mood 😄)

I’ll keep updating this repo as I learn more. Thanks for stopping by!
